# Status discipline

Every dictionary row carries exactly one status. A status is not a label of confidence; it is
a **contract about what the V&V suite is allowed to assert** about that row. The honesty
meta-gate enforces it mechanically.

| Status | Meaning | What V&V may assert | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| `some-true` | Established: an F1 theorem, a realized uor-addr operation, or a holospaces `vv` witness. | A green, gating check that the implementation reproduces the sourced fact. | gating `suite` |
| `build` | A precisely-scoped construction on sourced pieces, validated against universal axioms or an exact in-repo certificate. | That the construction satisfies the **MTC axioms** (hexagon, Yang–Baxter, SL(2,ℤ), Verlinde, …) or carries an exact certificate — never that it is *the* unique object. | gating `suite` |
| `open` | A genuine unknown. Measured and reported, never asserted true. | Only *measurements*. The claim itself is reported, never asserted true. | non-gating `target` |

**External-anchor rule (strengthened).** A `some-true` row must carry an **external source
anchor** — an F1 theorem name, a realized uor-addr operation, or a holospaces `vv` witness.
A source of "(derived)" is never acceptable for `some-true`: derived constructions belong at
`build` (or `open` if genuinely unknown).

The UTQC inner product is the positive-definite Euclidean composition norm `Σxᵢ²` — a manifest
sum of squares — so "generators are unitary" is genuine orthogonality, established directly.

## The inner product

The UTQC inner product is the **Euclidean composition norm** `⟨x,x⟩ = Σxᵢ²` — positive-definite
outright. Generators are coordinate permutations, hence orthogonal w.r.t. this form, hence
unitary. This is established directly, with no further assumption.

The multiplicative composition norm `|x|²|y|² = |xy|²` (the octonion eight-square) is what makes
the Atlas composition norm-multiplicative; it is `some-true`.

## Forbidden assertions

The honesty gate fails CI if any feature line affirmatively asserts, as established, an `open`
claim. `advantage` is `open` (tier `target`, non-gating): its content-addressed deduplication
(cache-collapse) metrics are *measured and reported* via `just report`, never asserted as a
proven quantum advantage.

Open claims may be *probed and reported*; their truth value is never green while they are `open`.
