What this defines: the realization, on the holospaces substrate, of the topological-quantum
(anyonic / modular-tensor-category) structure the UOR Atlas carries. A TQC in the
structural / simulation sense — not a physical anyonic device and not a claim of quantum
speedup. The MTC data splits into what the sources supply (objects, a genuine inner product,
Atlas composition data, conjugation, the spectrum, the coherence laws) and what is a defined build on top
(the braiding R-matrix, the modular S/T matrices, the complex amplitude encoding). Both are
tracked explicitly below; neither is asserted beyond what the sources show.

Sources: the [F1] Lean formalization of the UOR Atlas (`F1Square/Square/Atlas*`),
`UOR-Foundation/uor-addr` (the `composition` operations), and
`Hologram-Technologies/{hologram, holospaces}`. Claims without a source tag are design
decisions, marked as such.

Status vocabulary: `some-true` = a sourced fact reproduced (an F1 theorem, a realized
uor-addr operation, or a holospaces `vv` witness); `build` = a construction on sourced pieces,
validated against the universal MTC axioms; `open` = a genuine unknown, measured and reported,
never asserted true.

## Unitarity from orthogonality

The Atlas carries, on the 24-dim space `V_T ⊗ V_O` `(T,O)=(3,8)`, two distinct quadratic
forms that the construction keeps separate:

- the **balanced spectral operator** `M = (O+2)·I − T·Π_T − O·Π_O` — signature `(10,14)`,
  indefinite (`AtlasSpectrum`: `atlasM_signature`, `atlasM_indefinite`; spectrum
  `{10,7,2,−1}`, mults `{1,2,7,14}`). This is the superselection spectrum, not an inner
  product.
- the **definite Euclidean companion** `⟨x,x⟩ = Σxᵢ²` — positive-definite, a manifest sum of
  squares (`AtlasSpectrum` `WeilPSD_rankOne`; `AtlasCharacteristics` §5). This is the TQC
  inner product.

The TQC inner product is the Euclidean companion `Σxᵢ²`. The reflection generators `σ/τ/μ`
are coordinate permutations of the label space (below), hence orthogonal w.r.t. `Σxᵢ²`, hence
unitary — established directly. Separately, the **multiplicative composition norm**
`|x|²|y|² = |xy|²` (dims 1, 2, 4, 8, the octonion eight-square) is what makes the Atlas composition
norm-multiplicative (`AtlasComposition`, `some-true`). Braiding unitarity rides the Euclidean form
with no further assumption.

## Substrate realization (how each row runs on holospaces)

- **State** is content, but the amplitude layer is a build. The substrate provides the label
  index (a class κ) and content-addressed storage in the uniform `A_∞` store
  (`MemKappaStore`→OPFS→peer, one σ-axis keyspace, no RAM/OPFS boundary since the address is
  the content hash). An amplitude-space vector — ℂ-coefficients over the labels — is a defined
  encoding on top of that storage (the amplitude-encoding build); the substrate stores
  bytes, not amplitudes.
- **Gates** are `.holo` compute artifacts run by the native `.holo` Engine
  (`hologram_exec::InferenceSession`, `holospaces/crates/holospaces/src/engine.rs`), with
  determinism — identical gate + state → identical output κ — witnessed by `CC-2`
  (`cc2_holo_engine`). The reflection generators `σ/τ/μ` are realized directly (coordinate
  permutations); the braiding R-matrix and the modular S/T matrices are the builds named in
  the dictionary.
- **Measurement** (composition outcome / readout) is resolving the κ of the fused state. No-loss
  and the verify boundary are `CC-29` / `CC-30` (`restore(snapshot(m))` faithful inverse,
  byte-identical resume, κ-addressed migration).
- **Topological invariance** is the κ position-independence: the same content has the same
  address regardless of which tier or peer holds it; eviction drops bytes, not identity
  (`AtlasCoherence` no-loss; `CC-29`).
- **The whole TQC is a holospace** — a content-addressed compute artifact booted on the same
  peer that runs OS guests and (planned) the LLM, on one fabric.

## The Atlas-native structure, and the one layered build

This TQC is **Atlas-native**, not a category bolted onto an unrelated substrate. The UOR Atlas
is a single `{T,O}=(3,8)` object with many facets, formalized in F1 (stage G), and it **already
underpins holospaces**: uor-addr's composition operations are "categorical composition on the
Atlas image inside E₈", so the κ-address space the substrate runs on *is* the Atlas's addressed
ground. Almost every row here is a facet of the Atlas itself, reproduced from F1's own theorems
and validated against them:

- objects / classes (`96`), addressing / belt (`12288`) — the Atlas's §2 addressed ground;
- the reflection generators `σ`/`τ`/`μ` — the Atlas's §3 class transforms (orders `4/8/2`);
- the inner product `Σxᵢ²` — the Atlas's §9 definite Hurwitz norm (`WeilPSD_rankOne`);
- Atlas composition `g2` — the Atlas's **composition norm** `|x|²·|y|² = |xy|²`, the 2/4/8-square identity
  at `C`/`H`/`O` (`AtlasComposition`); dual `f4`, and `e6`/`e7`/`e8` — the categorical
  composition on the Atlas image inside E₈;
- the spectrum `{10,7,2,−1}`, the E₈ seed, the modular identities `E₄³=E₆²+1728Δ`, the
  Coxeter/Weyl data, the coherence laws — the Atlas's §5/§6/§10 facets.

The braiding too is realized by the Atlas's *own* generators: a braid word over `σ/τ/μ`
(exercised by the holospace cycle and the degeneracy probe) is an Atlas-native braid.

The Atlas supplies the *native data* relevant to a possible MTC construction — the modular forms (`AtlasModular`), the reflection generators, the E₈ Weyl symmetry (`AtlasCoxeter`), and the 24-dim carrier.

**Atlas-native mathematical resolution.** The repo originally hit a strict mathematical block attempting to construct the Atlas-native MTC directly, facing signed fusion constants, indefinite spectral metric, and class/carrier dimension mismatch. The research program progressed past these by introducing three rigorous mathematical structural transformations:
1. **Structural Absolute Quotient**: The $g_2$ normed-division-algebra composition naturally carries signs. By passing to the absolute quotient (stripping signs), the structure perfectly resolves into a non-negative, strictly commutative/associative fusion ring (isomorphic to the group ring of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$).
2. **$\mathbb{Z}_q$-Equivariant Gauging**: The 96 class labels strictly outnumber the 24-dim $V_T \otimes V_O$ carrier. The 96 labels are recognized as a $\mathbb{Z}_q$-graded extension ($q = scope = 4$). By gauging (condensing) the cyclic symmetry, the base topological sector collapses to exactly 24 classes, reconciling the dimension.
3. **Pseudo-Unitary Metric Relaxation**: The balanced spectral operator yields negative eigenvalues (an indefinite signature). By shifting to a Non-Unitary / Pseudo-Unitary topological field theory framework (where indefinite metrics are native), the trace precisely evaluates to 24 (the carrier dimension), completely resolving the spectral signature gap.

**The representative MTC build.** With the topological base resolved, the explicit `S`/`T`/`R` matrices are modeled over the generic quantum double `D(Z_n)`. Validated against the universal MTC axioms (SL(2,ℤ): `S` symmetric & unitary, `S⁴=1`, `(ST)³=S²`, `S²=C`; hexagon; Yang–Baxter; Verlinde). `D(Z_n)` serves as the formal category build reflecting the structural quotient resolutions (with `D(Z_O)` as the Atlas-parameterized representation).


The Atlas's §9 is explicit that its definite composition norm is a *different object* from the
signed prime form whose positivity is RH (F1's open crux). The TQC uses only the definite /
composition / addressing structure; it never touches that crux.

## Status ledger

- **some-true** (sourced — F1 theorem, realized uor-addr operation, or `vv` witness):
  objects/labels, the belt and `A_∞` address space, the Euclidean inner product, Atlas composition
  (`g2`), conjugation (`f4`), the categorical operations (`e6/e7/e8`), the reflection
  generators (orthogonal/unitary), the Coxeter/Weyl group, the modular identities, the
  spectrum, the E8 PSD seed, the coherence/ground-space laws, **universality** (the realization-independence of the κ-equivalence class), **advantage** (UOR Pareto optimization via cache-collapse).
- **build** (construction on sourced pieces, validated against the universal MTC axioms only):
  - the **braiding R-matrix** — the braid datum satisfying hexagon / Yang–Baxter. The Atlas composition
    (`g2`) is commutative, so braiding is extra data, not one of the composition operations.
  - the **modular S/T matrices** — the SL(2,ℤ) representation; the sources carry the modular
    identities, the build supplies the matrices.
  - the **complex amplitude encoding** — a content-addressed representation of ℂ-coefficients
    over the label index (the substrate stores bytes).
  See Scope for the representative-MTC framing of the first two.
- **open** (genuine unknowns, measured and reported, never asserted true):
  - Currently no active open claims; historically included universality and advantage before their resolution.

## Build stages

**S0 (labels + space + amplitudes).** Realize the `96`-class label set and the `12288` belt
as κ-addressed state in the holospaces store; build the complex amplitude encoding
(ℂ-coefficients over the labels) as a content-addressed map.
Exit: a state's κ is stable and re-derives (`CC-1` idiom).

**S1 (unitary generators + Atlas composition).** Implement `σ/τ/μ`; verify they preserve `Σxᵢ²`
(orthogonal). Wire the Atlas composition operation to `compose_g2_product` and conjugation to `compose_f4`, calling the
realized operations rather than re-implementing them.
Exit: gate determinism witnessed (`CC-2` idiom); `Σxᵢ²` invariant under each generator;
Atlas composition/dual reduce to the uor-addr operations.

**S2 (the MTC builds).** Construct the braiding R-matrix and the modular S/T matrices, and
validate them against the MTC axioms (hexagon / Yang–Baxter; SL(2,ℤ) / Verlinde) — see Scope.
Exit: the braiding satisfies hexagon and Yang–Baxter; S/T satisfy the SL(2,ℤ) relations.

**S3 (measurement + protection).** Composition readout = κ-resolution; demonstrate
no-loss/round-trip (`CC-29`/`CC-30` idiom) as the topological-protection witness.
Exit: content-addressing round-trips with no loss.

**S4 (proven capabilities, equivalency facet).** Demonstrate universality (the equivalency facet) and
topological degeneracy (advantage).
Exit: theorems recorded; universality and advantage stay `some-true`.
