Feature: Universality (equivalency facet)
  Universality is realization-independence: the TQC operates on the universal κ-equivalence class,
  never the original bytes. Distinct realizations of one topological operator resolve to the exact
  same κ. The substrate's holospaces inherit this universally.

  Scenario: realization-independence is witnessed across realizations
    Given the UOR Atlas use-case
    Then the same topological operator resolves to identical κ across the two independent realizations
