Feature: Atlas composition operation g2
  The Atlas composition operation g2 (historically named 'fusion-g2', but distinct from categorical MTC fusion) 
  is the realized CS-G2 commutative product on every sigma-axis (sha256, blake3,
  sha3-256, keccak256, sha512), and the composition norm is multiplicative at the use-case's
  context level (the octonion eight-square at O=8).

  Scenario: Atlas composition is commutative and norm-multiplicative
    Given the UOR Atlas use-case
    Then the composition reduces to the realized g2 product on every sigma-axis

  Scenario Outline: Atlas composition holds for arbitrary use-cases
    Given an arbitrary use-case with scope <q> modality <T> context <O>
    Then the composition reduces to the realized g2 product on every sigma-axis

    Examples:
      | q | T | O |
      | 4 | 3 | 8 |
      | 2 | 2 | 4 |
